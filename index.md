## FAQ
### How do I refresh signals?
Pull down on the dashboard or tap the refresh icon. The needle recalculates within ~3 seconds.

### Why did alerts pause?
Switching timeframes briefly pauses alerts while new data loads. Keep the app open or toggle notifications off/on in Settings.

### Can I export history?
Yes. Settings → Export Activity emails a CSV of needle phases and CAB events.
